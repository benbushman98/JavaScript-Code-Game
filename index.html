            <p>Test your knowledge on JavaScript. Play through this interactive game to see how much you know about the scripting language. 
                Once you hit the "Start Quiz Button" a timer will begin. With every question you answer incorrectly, time will be deducted from you.
                Once you are finished, your remaining time will be your score. The player with the highest score is the WINNER! Have fun!
